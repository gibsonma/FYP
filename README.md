##Structure

Inside the Data Structures directory I have seperated my work into the three sub directories, with each representing a module of my project.

For example, heading into the Ring_Buffer directory, displays the source code I use in implementing in project and in addition, the data I have collected.

All Excel Speadsheets appended with the term '_old' are outdated data that I collected and was not used in the final version of my project. This could have been due to several reasons, say for example, that I discovered an error in my data collection methods or I devised a more efficient implementation of an algorithm.
