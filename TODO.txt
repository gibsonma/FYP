Ring Buffer Results:

	Best Locks - CAS TAS TTAS
	TTAS better than variations
	TAS better than variations
	TICKET_RELAX better
	Size can affect performance on some locks such as TAS but not others like locked or cas
	SOme locks keep performance across architectures like TAS but not others like mutex

Singly Linked List Results:
	Best Locks - CAS, TAS, TTAS
	Lockless good at low thread counts but falls off
	TTAS best out of variations
	Size impacts heavily due to time spent travsering list
	Robustness across architectures dependant on implementation
	
Doubly Linked Buffer Results:
	Best Locks - CAS, TAS, TTAS
	Lockless matches locks in performance until 4 then drops hard
	TTAS best variation
	TASWP best variation
	CAS best variatiomn
	TICKET_RELAX better
	Size makes a difference to some, not all, especially lockless
	Mutex performs similarly on different architectures, CAS and lockless do not
	
Singly Linked Buffer Results
	Best Locks - TTAS, TAS, CAS, locked
	Lockless performs similarly to pthread mutex lock, outperformed by TTAS
	TTAS best
	TASWP best
	CAS best
	Ticket relax outperforms ticker early
	None of the locks tested performed similarly on architectures
	
Hash Table Results:
	Best Global Locks - CAS, TTAS, TASWP
	Same for lock per bucket
	Lockless good at thread count 2, falls sharply afterwards
	Resize affects some locks more than others
	Size of the table doesn't seem to do much
	TTAS best for both variations, lock per bucket gets beaten by TASNP until 4 threads
	TASWP best
	Architecture affects all locks tested
	
: Millions of iterations/second by number of threads for the ring buffer on the machine Stoker. “128 Key Range” indicates that the maximum length of the ring buffer array is 128. “TTAS No Pause”, “TTAS” and “TTAS_RELAX” represent the test-and-test-and-set-no-pause, the test-and-test-and-set and the test-and-test-and-set-relax lock implementations respectively.

: Hardware performance data gathered from the three ring buffer test-and-test-and-set implementations tested in figure 3. The test-and-test-and-set-no-pause, the test-and-test-and-set and the test-and-test-and-set-relax lock implementations.

How robust are the ring buffer implementations across different architectures
