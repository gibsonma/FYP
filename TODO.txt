Ring Buffer Results:

	Best Locks - CAS TAS TTAS
	TTAS better than variations
	TAS better than variations
	TICKET_RELAX better
	Size can affect performance on some locks such as TAS but not others like locked or cas
	SOme locks keep performance across architectures like TAS but not others like mutex

Singly Linked List Results:
	Best Locks - CAS, TAS, TTAS
	Lockless good at low thread counts but falls off
	TTAS best out of variations
	Size impacts heavily due to time spent travsering list
	Robustness across architectures dependant on implementation
	
Doubly Linked Buffer Results:
	Best Locks - CAS, TAS, TTAS
	Lockless matches locks in performance until 4 then drops hard
	TTAS best variation
	TASWP best variation
	CAS best variatiomn
	TICKET_RELAX better
	Size makes a difference to some, not all, especially lockless
	Mutex performs similarly on different architectures, CAS and lockless do not
	
Singly Linked Buffer Results
	Best Locks - TTAS, TAS, CAS, locked
	Lockless performs similarly to pthread mutex lock, outperformed by TTAS
	TTAS best
	TASWP best
	CAS best
	Ticket relax outperforms ticker early
	None of the locks tested performed similarly on architectures
