Ring Buffer Results:

	Best Locks - CAS TAS TTAS
	TTAS better than variations
	TAS better than variations
	TICKET_RELAX better
	Size can affect performance on some locks such as TAS but not others like locked or cas
	SOme locks keep performance across architectures like TAS but not others like mutex

Singly Linked List Results:
	Best Locks - CAS, TAS, TTAS
	Lockless good at low thread counts but falls off
	TTAS best out of variations
	Size impacts heavily due to time spent travsering list
	Robustness across architectures dependant on implementation
